This is a project based learning (via Odin Project) lesson to learn basic MVC design pattern.

I learned in this project the following:
- What code should be put in controllers (basically the same as classes)
- The conciseness and organization provided by the MVC
- Why ExpressJS is seen as a very intuitive framework

### The next thing to learn is:
- How to integrate modern frontend frameworks with ExpressJS
